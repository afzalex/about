                                        in <b>Enbraun, India</b>. During that period I had worked on different

                                        standards, and selection of IT tools for the project. I had trained testers

                                        daily like I do in diary. Suppose a user want to get notified every
                                        Wednesday to watch a TV serial, or want to get reminded of somebody’s
                                        birthday, this could be done by this web application.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A good account management, nice looking notifiers (reminder gadgets), fully
                                        featured note writing area, cool self-developed (with jQuery) slider are
                                        present in this web application. All the changes done by user will be made
                                        on server instantly through ajax. Technologies that are used in this project
                                        are <b>PHP</b>, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, tinyMCE, <b>MySQL</b>, Apache Tomcat

                                <article>

                                        I developed that desktop application to organise a programming quiz
                                        competition in <a href="https://www.geu.ac.in/content/geu/en.html">Graphic
                                            Era University</a>.I developed it during my BTech graduation in 2017.
                                        This application had two interfaces, one for admin users and another for
                                        normal users (students taking quick competition). Admin user can create
                                        questions and review answers submitted by normal users. Normal users can
                                        give test, compile there code, and view their submitted data.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The screen of that application id divided into three horizontal resizable
                                        panels. First panel contain questions created by admin users, that panel is
                                        editable when logged into application as admin user and is non-editable when
                                        logged in as normal user. Second panel has editable area for normal user to
                                        write answer program for provided questions. Third panel contained tools to
                                        compile and check output of written program. Application has a clock showing
                                        count down time to normal user, after which they cannot edit their answers
                                        i.e. second panel will become non-editable. I needed another application to
                                        collect answers from all user's computers. I had written native functions in
                                        <b>C</b> language to allow communication between C program and Java program.

                                        Technologies used in this application are <b>Java Swing</b>, SAX (Simple API

                                        Developed it with a team of 4 members using struts2 framework during my
                                        industrial training at <a href="https://www.dituniversity.edu.in/">DIT

                                        web application was assumed to be used by bank employees to register user
                                        account, register online accounts, to do transactions etc. Then customer can
                                        have his own net banking account and they can do transactions himself. This
                                        web application was having a Multilanguage (English and Spanish) feature,
